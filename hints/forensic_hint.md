Structured Approach to Solving Forensic CTF Challenges (Guideline):

0. Initial Assessment:
    - Identify Forensic Area: Determine the focus (e.g., memory, disk, network).
    - Analyze Hints: Extract key details from the challenge description (e.g., file types, artifacts).
    - Inventory Resources: List available tools and resources.
    - Plan Additional Tools: Note tools to install if needed (e.g., Autopsy, Volatility, Wireshark).

1. File Handling and Initial Analysis:
    - Backup Files: Ensure original data remains untouched.
    - Inspect Files: Use `file`, `strings`, `exiftool`, `binwalk` for non-destructive examination.
    - Document Findings: Record readable text, headers, metadata, and anomalies.
    - Extract Relevant Data: Save important data segments separately.

2. Metadata and Timeline Construction:
    - Extract Metadata: Utilize tools like `exiftool` to gather file metadata.
    - Create Timeline: Organize events chronologically to identify patterns.
    - Spot Anomalies: Detect unusual timestamps or inconsistencies.

3. Data Recovery and Carving:
    - Locate Fragments: Use `foremost` or `photorec` to find and recover file fragments.
    - Reassemble Files: Attempt to reconstruct complete files from fragments.
    - Verify Integrity: Check recovered files for completeness and accuracy.

4. Memory Forensics (if applicable):
    - Capture Memory: Use `Volatility` or `DumpIt` to obtain memory dumps.
    - Analyze Processes: Examine running processes and services.
    - Detect Malicious Activity: Identify malware or unauthorized access signs.

5. Network Forensics (if applicable):
    - Collect Traffic: Use `Wireshark` or `tcpdump` to capture network packets.
    - Examine Protocols: Analyze used protocols for suspicious activity.
    - Reconstruct Sessions: Trace data flows to identify potential breaches.

6. Log File Examination:
    - Gather Logs: Collect logs from systems and applications.
    - Parse and Filter: Use tools like `Logstash` or `Splunk` to organize log data.
    - Identify Patterns: Look for repetitive errors or unusual access attempts.

7. Correlate Artifacts:
    - Cross-Reference Data: Compare findings from various sources to find connections.
    - Build Context: Develop a comprehensive view of the event sequence.
    - Identify IOCs: Pinpoint indicators of compromise or malicious activities.

8. Documentation and Reporting:
    - Compile Findings: Organize all discovered information clearly.
    - Detail Methods: Describe the tools and techniques used.
    - Provide Recommendations: Suggest actions to mitigate identified issues.
    - Ensure Clarity: Present the report understandably for all audiences.

9. Continuous Improvement:
    - Review Process: Assess the effectiveness of methods and tools used.
    - Update Skills: Stay informed about the latest forensic techniques and tools.
    - Incorporate Feedback: Refine approaches based on lessons learned.
